Crown Heights Food Map
======================

This is a project to create an online map of community gardens, CSAs, and other food justice resources in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Built using [Mapbox's Google Docs plugin](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox.js/blob/master/extensions/mapbox.converters.googledocs.js) and looking at lots of reference material.
